Nowadays, an ever-increasing volume of information on the Internet has made many websites offer recommendation systems to help customers to quickly find items that satisfy their needs. Such accurate systems should not act in a greedy manner and must balance the need to explore the current user preferences and the exploitation of the rating information for recommendation. Reinforcement learning has demonstrated to be a potentially effective approach to solve the exploration/exploitation dilemma by generating recommendations as a sequential optimization problem; nevertheless, it has received relatively little attention and found only limited application as its computational complexity made the problem intractable when there is a large number of items to recommend.This dissertation project aims is to demonstrate that recent advances in deep reinforcement learning are now useful to build a model that learns how to generate good recommendations by reducing the complexity of acting over a large set of items. A comparison of the performance between a reinforcement learning agent based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm with k-nearest neighbors and two different item representations, and a new policy approach based on Factorization Ranking Recommendation demonstrates that both policy architectures work well under the recommendation task, but the Factorization Machine model slightly outperforms the performance of the kNN-based policy.
